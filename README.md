# Shameless

## About 
This is a project I've started to practice my full stack skills with particular focus on -

* React
* TailwindCSS 

Shameless Podcast is one of my favourite weekly podcasts. You can check them out here https://shamelessmediaco.com/ 

As part of their weekly episodes they a recommendations for books, movies, tv shows and other podcasts. The weekly recommendations are kept on a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SHDCM3D03X47IpPenKLboTeDaoaPspGS6IrDv0GqChA/edit#gid=334302862) and I thought it would be fun to recreate this as a full stack web app.
